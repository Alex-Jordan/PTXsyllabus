        Below is one course's breakdown of grades, to provide examples of <pretext/> structure.
    </p>

    <paragraphs>
        <title>Video Lecture Notes (4%)</title>
        <p>
            Just as with in-person lectures, taking notes during the lectures helps students understand
            and retain information. Each section has lecture notes that accompany the YouTube videos.
            Print these and fill them in as you watch the videos. (Or annotate a PDF digitally.)
            The completed lecture notes will be turned in before exams and checked for completeness.
