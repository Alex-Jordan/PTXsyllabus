    <title><webwork/> Assignments</title>

    <p>
        Below is one course's description of its online homework.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have made an account for you on an online homework platform called <webwork/>.
        You can access <webwork/> using the navbar in our D2L course.
        Each week there are problem sets and you are required to answer them online in <webwork/>.
        Each problem set is due at 10:00 <pm/> on Sunday at the end of that module's week.
        You may submit answers any time before the due date.
    </p>

        <title>Late Work</title>
        <p>
            After a due date, you still have up to two weeks to answer <webwork/> exercises
            and get 95% credit. It's usually a two-week window, however the window is shorter
            right before the midterm or final exam. The idea is that you really should
            complete all homework before coming in to take an exam.

        <title>Homework Sets Menu</title>
        <p>This shows you the assignments that have been assigned to you and when they are due. You may:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        click on an assignment and begin working on problems online
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        check the box next to an assignment and click <c>Download Hardcopy</c>
                        to get the assignment as a <c>.pdf</c> file
                        which you may then print to work on away from a computer.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            When you click on an assignment, you will see a screen with the problem numbers listed.
            To the right there is an information panel that might have specific instructions
            or other information about the assignment. You should always look for and read this panel.

        <title>Emailing for Help</title>
        <p>
            When you are stumped, you can use the <c>Email Instructor</c> button at the bottom of a page.
            Write a message explaining what you have tried. If possible, include work from your tries.
            <webwork/> will send me an email with helpful information (like all of the incorrect attempts
            you have tried) and I will get back to you soon with a response. When I respond, it will be
            with an email. So <alert>you must remember to check your email</alert>.

        <title>Math Achievements</title>
        <p>
            As you complete problems, you will win badges for various <q>achievements</q>.
            For example, the <q>On One Hand</q> badge is for completing an exercise set with fewer than
            five incorrect submissions. Earning badges and answering questions correctly will earn you
            <q>achievement points</q>. As you earn more achievement points, you will level up.
            Each time you level up, you earn an item that can be used to affect your grade.
