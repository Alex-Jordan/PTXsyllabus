        <title>Best Way to Contact Me</title>

        <p>
            The best way to contact me is by using the D2L Brightspace e-mail system
            which can be accessed from the Classlist.
            You can use it to send an e-mail to me and/or your classmates.
        </p>
        <p>
            You should include a relevant subject in the <c>Subject:</c> or <c>RE:</c> section
            of your e-mail. The subject should include the class you are taking
            (including the course number and CRN) and the topic of your message.
            For example, you email subject line might be:
            <cd>[SUBJ XXX - CRN XXXXX]: Help with Section 1.1 Homework</cd>
            If you treat your email subject line this way,
            it helps me prioritize getting back to you quickly.
            I get very maany emails every day from here and there, and I want your emails
            (my student's emails) to be the ones I address first.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your question or comment would be of interest to other students,
            please consider posting it to the General Discussions area instead.
            Then I can publicly answer your question,
            and the entire class will benefit from the answers.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also find me in Office Hours as described in
            <xref ref="section-contact-info" text="title"/>.

        <title>Responses from Me</title>

        <p>
            You can expect me to reply to your emails and discussion posts within 48 hours,
            and often much sooner. I often will not reply to messages sent in the evening
            until the following day.
